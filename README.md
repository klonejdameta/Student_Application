# Student_Application
This application stores and manages a student's data.
The data we store for a student are: ID (unique), name, surname, age, university and isworking.
The actions we can do with student data are: save them in a file, edit, delete and display data for all students.
I am currently working on editing and deleting data from the file, the rest of the application is functional.
